# Optimal Control Theory Application Using DARE

This repository presents an application of Optimal Control Theory using the
Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equation (DARE) to derive optimal trajectories of
state and control variables within a macroeconomic framework of Pakistan.

The model is developed as part of my MPhil thesis and is used to compute
optimal policy pathways that minimize a quadratic loss function subject to
dynamic state constraints.

## Objective
To determine the optimal paths of macroeconomic state variables and the policy
control variable by solving a discrete-time Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
problem using DARE.

## Model Framework
- Discrete-time linear state-space system
- Quadratic objective (loss) function
- Policy control variable (energy subsidy)
- State variables include:
  - Public debt
  - Fiscal deficit
  - Exchange rate
  - Inflation rate
  - Interest rate

## Methodology
- State-space representation
- Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equation (DARE)
- Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
- Forward simulation of optimal paths

## Tools 
-  R-Studio (R version 4.3.3)

## Outputs
- Optimal trajectories of state variables
- Optimal control paths
- Policy simulation figures
